   Academic Integrity Statement

   We, the people named in the @author comment above, have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies. We have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   The policies do permit some limited collaboration among students currently
   enrolled in the course. If we did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom we collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:

   - none

   Here are any deviations from the policies that we want to document, with the
   understanding that being honest about our mistakes is more honorable than
   lying about our intellectual work:

   - I am aware that I do not have to cite this but to be safe,
   I reused some code from the 3110 lecture materials and gitbook such as for 
   member, insert and balance in the RedBlackTree implementation and the 
   format_assoc function in treedictionary.ml. 


   We acknowledge that the partner collaboration policy requires all work to be
   done together. Both partners are equally responsible for the entire
   submission. It is against that policy to split up the work. But if we did
   violate that policy, here is how we split up the work:

   - N/A
